\chapter{Hyperspace}

Some physicists affirm that superimposed to our usual 4D spacetime there is another 4D spacetime which is usually called the dark or negative sector of our universe, the hyperspace or the counterspace. Notable examples of this are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Jean-Pierre Petit's "Janus cosmological model" (https://januscosmologicalmodel.com/)
	\item H. David Froning Jr. (see his book "Faster than light - Warp drive and quantum vacuum power")
	\item Nick Thomas conterspace (\href{http://nct.goetheanum.org/}{http://nct.goetheanum.org/})
	
\end{itemize}

The set usual 4D spacetime + dark sector is normally called the \emph{dual universe} in the literature. According to many mathematicians, a 5D manifold is equivalent to two 4D manifolds. It has been noted by several physicists that unification of relativity and electromagnetism is most easily achieved by assuming a 5D spacetime.

Thus the normal and dark sectors of the universe would work as the two light beams that interfere (superimpose) on a (4D) photographic plate to make up a (5D) hologram.

Some properties of hyperspace are:

\begin{itemize}
 \item It is the natural home of tachyons, dark matter and dark (or negative) energy.
 \item The metric is different that in the 'positive' 4D sector.
 \item Time runs in the oposite direction than in the 'positive' 4D sector.
 \item Chirality is reversed.
\end{itemize}

Physical phenomena involving hyperspace include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Quantum tunneling
	\item Quantum entanglement (see footnote)
	\item Evanescent waves
\end{itemize}

The relation between the 'positive' 4D sector and the hyperspace seem to be that of polar opposites in a stereographic projection\footnote{According to Irving Ezra Segal's article "Theoretical foundations of the chronometric cosmology" (Segal, I. E. (1976) Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 73, 669-673) the total energy of a photon is $E=E_0+E_1$, where $E_0$ is the usual positive relativistic energy, and $E_1$ is the super-relativistic energy, which is the transform of the relativistic energy by conformal inversion. Also according to his article "Covariant chronogeometry and extreme distances: Elementary particles" (Proc. NatL Acad. Sd. USA, Vol. 78, No. 9, pp. 5261-5265, September 1981), $E_0$ is the localized part of the photon's energy, whereas $E_1$ is the delocalized part. This could explain the phenomenon of quantum entanglement.} \\

This has some resemblance also to twistor theory, where there are two dual spaces, the usual 4D spacetime and the 4D spinor space. When you take into account both the positive and negative/dark sectors of the universe then you get two 4D spinor spaces, or in other words, a 8D twistor space.
